    "# Whether to normalize or denormalize the data...\n",
    "\n",
    "The grand question when working with semi-structured or Document-Oriented Data is when to efficiently store just one copy of data (Normalize the data) or store more copies of data as required by the use cases as subdocuments (Denormalize). TL:DR, it’s a balance. The ultimate goal of this balancing act is to ensure that your Aerospike cluster is responsive to more requests, and is not tied up in excessively I/O-, CPU-, or RAM/Storage-intensive operations. Aerospike cluster configurations afford significant flexibility, but ultimately the best practice is to create data for which: \n",

    "* Reads – the application has sufficiently fast access to the data needed for the app\n",
    "* Writes – having space and availability to write app data without running into Aerospike [known limitations](https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/guide/limitations.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately this depends on what data is needed for efficient transaction processing using Aerospike’s record-atomic transactions using the operate API method. By the nature of applications, the higher frequency of a type of transaction, the stronger the need for atomicity. \n"

    "# Finding the Balance between Size and Application Performance \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, larger records means larger reads from storage. In turn, larger reads from storage generally means a database will take at least as much time to access a record of data as a smaller record. At some point that is different for every database, application, and record type, too large of a record results in inadequate application performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aerospike has a large sweet spot for real time performance and Aerospike records technically have no size limit if stored in memory, starting with version 4.5.3.4. However, memory is finite, and therefore most records are written to a storage device. The most common range of record sizes for real time performance at scale is from 1 Byte to 128 KBs. At that size and using Aerospike default configuration:\n",
    "Performance times are more directly related to storage medium than processor or transport. (This is my understanding. Please vet if this is a safe claim to make.) \n",
    "Due to the current speed of network I/O, smaller sized records are only marginally faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Customers routinely create and use records that are larger than the 128-KB range. The maximum size for data stored on a device is 8 MiB. \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices are:\n",
    "1. Work with the Aerospike team to help you tune for performance for MB-sized records or extreme read/write workloads. You may also seek advice on Aerospike’s [Tuning Forum](https://discuss.aerospike.com/c/operations/tuning/23). \n",
    "2. Verify the server and client versions support necessary features.\n",
